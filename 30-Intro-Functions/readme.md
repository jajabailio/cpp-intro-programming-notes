# Intro to Functions
Functions are, as they say, "self-contained" codes that do (most of the time) specific task. Functions usually (but not all the time) take in data, processes it, then "return" the processed data as a result. As always, this will make more sense as we go through them but let's take things very slow.

## The main function
Probably the good time we talk about this, is the `main()` function. This function called main, for C++, is the default main function. The starting point. This is where the compiler's starting point when compiling the entire code. Now this isn't really the best example for functions right now because there are no input and visible return values, so let's just leave it for now. But just know, the main() is a function, and once you'll get the hang of functions, you'll get it.
