# Console
Just to sum it up, a console is pretty much a tool that let's users input commands for your computer to do. You can create, read, update, delete files and folders using the console, and a lot of other stuff. Including, displaying output from your compiled C++ programs. That's pretty much it. So, understand that for the basic of it, everytime we run our code, the result will be displayed in a console.
