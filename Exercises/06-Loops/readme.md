# Exercise 6 (Loops)

## Exercise 1
Create a while loop that displays numbers 1 - 100

## Exercise 2
Create a do-while loop that displays number 101-200. Must use only one counter

## Exercise 3
Create a for loop that will display numbers by 2 until 200. **Hint**: The counter should be incremented twice

## Exercise 4
Create a program where a loop (any) repeats 20 times, but the condition should be when a boolean variable `isRepeat` is true. In the loop sequence, firstly, it should display the counter like this `"count is 1"` followed by 2, 3, 4. Secondly, there should be a condition where when a counter is equal to 20, the boolean variable `isRepeat` will become `false` to end the loop.
