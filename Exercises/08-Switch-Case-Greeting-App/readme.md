# Exercise 5 (Greeting App)
Create a program that will display a list of greetings that a user can choose. You can up to 4 greetings that you want as long as the last one (5th) will display "Goodbye". Everytime a user selects a greeting, that will greeting will be displayed, and then it should display once more the list of greetings menu. This means that it will never stop asking for greetings for the user to select, unless the user chooses the "goodbye" choice.

Requirements:
- Needs to use a loop
- Loop will not stop unless user selects the "Goodbye" choice
- Use switch case to display different greetings based on what the user selects
