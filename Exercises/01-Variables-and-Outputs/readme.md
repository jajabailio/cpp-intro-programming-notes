## 5 Variables
Create a program that has 5 variables. `name`, `age`, `hobby`, `yearBorn` and `dislike` and make sure that they have values. Afterwards, display those variables within a sentence. It's up to you for the sentence content but try to put some sense into it. The expected output should be something like `Hi! My name is Janssen` as one output. `Janssen` of course, is the variable.
