# Final Test (Modified Calculator)
This is where we put all our learnings to the test

Create a simple calculator that asks the user for 2 numbers and solves them based on the selected operation.

### Requirements:
- Operations must include `+, -, * and /`
- The program must have a menu list for the user to select which operation they want to use.
- The program must ask the user for 2 numbers
- Use switch-case statement to handle each operations
- Each operation must have a function to handle the expression based on the selected operation
- Each function must have a function prototype
- The result of the expression in each function needs to be returned to where it was called
- Display the result of each expression in the main function.
- In the menu list, there should be one more item for the user to choose that is not an operation, but rather a string saying "Close".
- Wrap the program in a loop. This means that after every result displayed in the expression, the program will display once more the menu for the user to select which operation they want and enter 2 numbers. This also means that the program will keep on showing the menu after every computed expression from the selected operation.
- Selecting the "Close" option in the menu will end the loop and will end the program.

### Notes

- Don't worry if you don't get it the first time. What's important is you give your all in trying to solve this.
- Even if takes you a whole day, or even a whole week. Try everything you can think of.
- If in the end you weren't able to get it, watch the solution, and then do the test again WITHOUT looking at the solution

Good luck!
