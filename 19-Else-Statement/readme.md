# Else Statement
Else statement is a statement that is always connected to an IF. That means, an else cannot stand alone. The else statement is just a section of code that executes whan its if statement's condition is false


```c++
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

if(a > b) {
	cout << "a is greater than b";
} else {
	cout << "a is less than b";
}

cout << endl;
```
In this example, we have an if statement with the condition `a > b`, when the condition is true, it will run the code inside the if statement, ignoring the else statement. On the other hand, if the condition is false, then it will execute the else statement.
