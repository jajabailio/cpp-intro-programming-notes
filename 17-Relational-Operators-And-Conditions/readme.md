# Relational Operators
Relational operators are symbols we can use to compare 2 or more values. Think of it as just comparing whether one thing is the same as another thing, or that if it's different. You'll see it in examples to better understand this.

Again, I mentioned that it is a comparison of 2 or more values. Let's have the example of


```c++
	int a = 10;
	int b = 15;

	// we can tell that a is less than b, or we can also say that b is greater than a based on their values. But how can we write that in our program? We can simply say

	cout << (a > b) << endl;

```
 This is called a condition. To sum this up, a condition is a comparison between 2 values. The result of a condition will always be a boolean. That is to say, the result will either be true, or false.

 In C++, when you try to console out a boolean value, you're not actually gonna get the words true or false, but rather you will only get 1 or 0. Binaries. 1 simply means its true, and 0 means its false.

## Other Relational Operators

(>) -> Greater than
(<) -> Less than
(==) -> Equal to
(!=) -> Not equal to
(>=) -> Greater than or Equal to
(<=) -> Less than or Equal to
