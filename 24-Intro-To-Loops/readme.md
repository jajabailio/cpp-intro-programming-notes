# Loops
Loop is pretty much repeating a sequence of codes until a condition is reached. Loops will need a condition because it determines whether we want to keep repeating the code or stop it. So, conditions in loops are very similar to those in if statements. Before I give examples I want to talk about the different type of loops.
