# Input Stream
Unlike the output, the input stream will be something that the user will interact with the computer and enter something as an input. In the `iostream` that we included, there is also the `cin` command that we will ask the user to input.

## Input into variable
Here is an example usage of `cin`

```c++
	int num;

	cin >> num;

	cout << "The number you entered is: " << num << endl;
```

As you can see, when we input something, there needs to be a variable that can catch/store what the use will input.
