# Integrated Development Environment
From the words "Development Environment", it just means this is where we're going to write our code. This is the "environment" where we "develop" our program. Pretty self explanatory. There are a lot of IDEs out there. Some common ones are Visual Studio or VSCode, Codeblocks (I think), Webstorm, Jetbrains, XCode (for Mac), and etc. 

## Windows option
For windows, there is a free software called "Visual Studio" by Microsoft. The community version is free. I'll leave a link in the desecription. I won't be going through the setup, cause it's out of the scope, but I can leave a reference to where you can follow and install this software and use it to code C++

## Mac option
For Mac ios, I'm just using the XCode which you can download on the App Store for free.

Once you have downloaded and installed your IDE, we are now ready to program!
