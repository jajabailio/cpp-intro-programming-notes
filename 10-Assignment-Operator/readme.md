# Assignment Operator

An assignment operator is the equal (=) sign. From the word "Assignment", it means that we assign a value to something

In the previous section, we talked about Variables, but the variables we created do not have any values. They are just empty containers.

```c++
int main () {

	string name = "Janssen";
	int age = 24;
	char gender = 'G';
	bool isAwesome = false;
	float mathGrade = 94.4;
	// can also use double

	return 0;
}
```

As of the moment, you can see that there are no values for each variables. That's because we have to assign values to each of them using the assignment operator.
