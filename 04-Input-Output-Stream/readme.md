# Input Output Stream
Once you've added the `include <iostream>` in a cpp folder, we can do some basic input and output. I'll give more examples later but I just want to make one thing clear here, just so you know. Every input, is something that you as the user registers. Anything the computer shows, is an output. Examples of inputs can be the keyboard and mouse. The keys you enter are inputs. The output can the display of your input, or even sound coming from your speakers. Those are general examples of input and output. In this beginner series, our main input and output stream will mostly be just you entering keys from your keyboard as an input, and displaying the result in a "console" as the output.

Here is an example of an output to the console

```c++
	cout << "Hello World!";
```

Speaking of consoles, this is what we're gonna talk about next
