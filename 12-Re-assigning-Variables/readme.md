# Reassigning Variable
Is very common in programming, which simply means that we are reassigning a value to a variable

```c++
	int num = 10;		// initialize

	cout << num << endl;
	cout << num << endl;

	num = 11;

	cout << num << endl;
	cout << num << endl;
```
| Notice the difference between line 5 and 10. The first one has `int` which means it's not reassigning, but defining/initializing
