# What is a Compiler?
A compiler is a tool which can typically be available in your IDE, that literally compiles your code. Meaning, this tool will read your entire code from top to bottom and making sure there are no syntactical errors. Once a compiler finishes compiling a program, it will be able to execute it. Normally, when there are errors, the program will exit or not run at all.
