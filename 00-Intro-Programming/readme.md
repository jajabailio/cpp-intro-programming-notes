# What is Programming
Simply put, programming is just a set of instructions telling your computer what to do.

## Why Programming?
- It pays well
- It trains your mind to think critically. When you repeatedly do programming, (personal opinion) it does make you smarter. I'm not saying I'm very smart but I do believe that it made me smarter than before I did programming, only because it sort of trained my mind to critically think.
- It is a high in demand job. I previously asked my employer from Germany and also from Australia, and even in the US, that Web Developers, Programmers, Software Engineers, you name it, are a very in demand job.

## Sample Salaries in Different Countries
- US: $116,879 per year
- Philippines: â‚±788,690 per year (Around 55k average a month)
- AU: $111,429 (glassdoor)

## Things To Keep In Mind
- Programming is hard (but so as any new skill you're learning), but repetition is key. It gets easier
- Your perseverance will be put to the test. Don't get discouraged, it's not that daunting. But like any other skill, you have to also put in the work, put in the hours (as the Rock says it). Programming is literally like any other skill.
- There's a lot to take in, so take breaks when you need to - You can always go in your own pace when learning programming. Don't get burnout
- Be consistent - Like I said. Repetition is key. Try to make a habit of coding at least a few minutes a day, or every weekday. Once you miss like a lot of days all the time, you're not gonna fully grasp the lessons as effectively as you want it to.

## Outro
That's pretty much it. Hopefully you'll learn a lot, and let's get started
