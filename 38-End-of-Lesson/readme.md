# End of Beginner Course
If you've made it this far, Congratulations! I hope you learned much and I know that I crammed every bit of lessons that I can into this video, so it's totally understandable if you weren't able to understand it all in one go.

## Pointers
- Repetition is key: Doing a bunch of programming exercises, even the ones you've already done will help you familiarize yourself with how you write code.
- Map your code: If there are things you don't understand on how/why things worked like that, map out the code. Try to understand every bit of it. It may be time consuming and tedious, but it will help you a lot on understanding why the code works the way it does.
- Take breaks: It's normal to feel overwhelmed to take in a lot of information in a short period of time.

I am planning on making another programming video in C++ but this time it will be more on intermediatte. So, let's hope I'll be able to make that. Thank you and have a good day.
