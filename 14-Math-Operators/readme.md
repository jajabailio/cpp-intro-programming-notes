# Math Operators
Math operators are just the simple operations we already know most of. So we have the usual +, -, * and /, and then there are the maybe not so common ones () and %

## Priority Heirarchy
Even though we know most of these operations, I think the important thing to discuss here is knowing which operations is done first given a complex expression.

That means to say, if we have an expression like `3 + 2 * 5 - 2 / 2 + (12 - 1)`, we would be able to solve the answer for this if we know the order of operations to do first.

## PMDAS
If you don't know what PMDAS is, it basically means "Parenthesis, Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction". Always remember the PMDAS so that you will know which order comes first.

## Modulus
I feel like modulus is something we need to talk about because it's the least common out of all operation. So, modulus with a '%' sign
