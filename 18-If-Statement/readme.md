# If Statement
The if statement is a decision making statement. That is to say, we can specify whether we want to run a certain code in an if statement. Let me show you an example.


```c++

int a = 100;
int b = 200;

if(a < b) {
	cout << "a is less than b" << endl;
}

if(a > b) {
	cout << "a is greater than b";
}

if(a == b) {
	cout << "a is equal to b" << endl; 
}

if(a != b) {
	cout << "a is not equal to b" << endl;
}

cout << "Done" << endl;

```

So as you can see, when the condiiton is true, that means its correct, then we execute the code within it.
