# Modulus
The modulus is a lot like the division operator, but instead of getting the quotient as the answer, we get the remainder.

## Refreshser
For example, let's have the expression `2 / 2`. We know that the answer to this expression is 1. 1 is the quotient of 2 / 2. But, what if it was `2 % 2`? This expression means that we will divide 2 itself, but instead of getting the quotient, we get the remainder. What is the remainder of 2 / 2? The answer is 0. Because there is no remainder of 2/2. But, what about 3/2? The answer is 1 remainder 1.

```c++
	int quotient = 3 / 2;
	int remainder = 3 % 2;

	cout << quotient << endl;
	cout << remainder << endl;
```
