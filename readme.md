# C++ Beginner Totorial
In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of programming with the use of C++ as our language.

> üí° Programming languages differ mostly on syntax and usages, but the foundations are the same

## Importance of Foundation
Creating a foundation for your programming is essential as it will help you develop some critical thinking skills and focus more on the logic of some programs.

üçé Example: Say, you want to create your own calculator program. You will need to know how make your program read each numbers inserted by a user, and each operation between two numbers, to know what to do with them. With this is mind, the logic will be the same for every language, it's just that the syntaxes change.
