# Data Types
What are data types? To make it very basic, data type just describes what type of data or information it is. Try to think of different data. We have names, age, address, telephone number, gender, birthday. This are all data. But, we need to specify what kind of data it is.

Now we're going to talk about different data types. There a couple of them but I'll discuss the most common ones. We have an integer, a float/double, boolean, string and characters

- An integer is any whole number, be it positive or negative
- A float is any number that has decimal places
- A character is just a single key that can be an alphabet or number (alphanumeric) or even special characters. !important: It should be wrapped around single quotes
- A string is just many characters wrapped in double quotes.
- A boolean only has 2 values. `true` or `false`

Don't worry if you're not too familiar with them for now. We'll have more examples of these data types as we go on

# Values
At this point on, I'll be using the term "Value" for the data. Don't get me wrong, there is a difference between the data and value. The data is pretty much saying what information are we working on. So, say the "name", or "first name", or "age". Those can be referred as DATA. The value is pretty much what the data is. Like for "name", the value can be "Janssen" which is my name. The data "age" can have the value of "19" which can be my age for example. So, I hope I'm not making this confusing for you, but just know that the VALUE is pretty much the instance of a data. Like what that data is in specific.
