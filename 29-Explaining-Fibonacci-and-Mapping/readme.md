# Fibonacci Explained

```c++
	// put answer here
```

Key Notes:

- You should have an extra variable to always get the previous latest number in the set, before setting the new latest number
- Each time there is a new number to be added in the Fibonacci sequence, it should be added as well in the string

## About Code Mapping
Something that I learned in college (not sure if it's even the right term), but we used to map our code to be able to make sense of it all. When you map a code, here are key points.

- Follow the correct order of sequence codes. (Like eg. will it go into the if statement? Loop?)
- Never miss a line (you don't have to look into too much per line but just skimming through them is enough) 
- Write down each variables and their values and even everytime the value changes
- Always check variable values when they are used (especially in conditions and loops)
